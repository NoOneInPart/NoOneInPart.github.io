            <h2>Weird mug cupcake thing</h2>
            <p>I was browsing the internet and I came across <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241038/microwave-chocolate-mug-cake/" target="_blank"> this wonderful recipe involving microwaved cupcakes in a mug</a>. Seemed easy, but it turns out my incompetence
                in cooking is worse than I thought.</p>

            <h2>Chemistry project video</h2>
            <p>I had to work on a video with some classmates about nuclear decay. It was pretty terrible.</p>
