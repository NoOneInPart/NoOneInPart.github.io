        great zoo was created in 1987, when a group of Dr. Williams
        former students decided to create a zoo in honor of their great
        algebra teacher (who loved animals). Ironically, while in they
        were students of his, they were assigned a project where they
        had to create a zoo and spend $999,000-$1,000,000 on animals.
        Being the smart kids that they are, they used their old research
        to create a new zoo, dedicated to the great teacher himself. The
        rest is history.</font><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp; To be honest, there's no information on the
        internet about this obscure zoo. The little information I
        received from the manager is as follows:<br>
      </i><br>
      <i>Zoo built in 1987</i><br>
      <i>There were 5 animals at its introduction</i><br>
      <i>A contract was signed with <b>Al Donald Fast Food Franchises
          Company</b> in order for food to be ordered at the zoo</i><br>
      <i>3 more animals were introduced in 1993</i><br>
      <i>A playground was built 1 year later</i><br>
      <i>4 more animals were added in 1995</i><br>
      <i>Shut down in 2000 due to lack of interest.</i><br>
    </font><i><font color="#000000"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am only keeping this site up because it
        intrigues me that such a place ever existed. I remember visiting
        the zoo back in '97. The place was very quiet. Absolutely no
        visitors, except for myself. I was on my way to get info (see
        above) about the zoo for this website. There was trash
        everywhere. The place smelled like animal 5h1t. The animals
        looked miserable. The park was un-watered. The food was either
        undercooked or overcooked or microwaved. I saw only one person
        at the zoo, and it was a little kid. He seemed to be running the
        zoo, all by himself. The manager was no where to be seen. I
        couldn't talk to the boy; whenever I tried, he responded with
        the "Is that guy on c-a-k" look. After spending at least 1 hour
        there, I received a phone call on my mobile telephone from the
        manager himself. He told me to go to his house.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I arrived, I saw a very large and well
        maintained house. It looked better than the zoo itself. I found
        him at his own mini golf course, and invited me to talk.
        Whenever he asked about what I thought of his "great zoo for
        kids," I lied and told him that "It was GREAT."&nbsp; He said he
        was pleased and gave me $1,000,000 to create this very website.
        I bet he spends less that that yearly on his zoo. For all I
        know, the kid probably also funds the zoo with the little money
        he gets from his manager. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple days after this website went online,
        the zoo was filing bankruptcy. I heard the net cost of the zoo
        was "a bit over nine thousand dollars." That's no too much,
        considering it included 12 animals and everything else in the
        zoo currently.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't hear anything about the zoo anymore.
        Apparently, it was sold to Google, where they sold all the
        animals to a (must I add, MUCH BETTER) zoo and demolished the
        place. Right now, there is a parking lot where it once stood.</font><br>
