            <h2>Final cooking attempt</h2>
            <p>Alright, this is going to be the last time I try out cooking just to post something on this blog. It's way too much effort just to
                keep this dead website alive. Here's some weird rice pastry I made. I think there's meat inside and I just wrapped it with rice
                on the outside using saran wrap or something. I don't even remember what recipe I followed. It looks about as good as it tastes.
                I'm done. I'm going to go take a nap or something.

            <h2>Another attempt at cooking with a mug and a microwave</h2>
            <p>Back on the internet again. This time, I found a post by someone who <a href="https://www.melskitchencafe.com/60-second-chocolate-chip-mug-cookie/" target="_blank">put the ingredients of a cookie into a mug and then microwaved the contents to make some sort of mug cookie thing.</a>
            Of course I made it, the work required is way too easy and it would be a shame not to try. It ended up looking nothing like what was on the website, but I guess it didn't taste bad. I wouldn't call it a cookie though.</p>

            <h2>Weird mug cupcake thing</h2>
            <p>I was browsing the internet and I came across <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241038/microwave-chocolate-mug-cake/" target="_blank"> this wonderful recipe involving microwaved cupcakes in a mug</a>. Seemed easy, but it turns out my incompetence
                in cooking is worse than I thought.</p>

            <p>I had to work on a video with some classmates about nuclear decay. It was pretty terrible.</p>
